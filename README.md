# Osim
Welcome to Osim,an simulation game where you simulate a company and shape it however you want 

The game will be created and maintained by a community of developers and gamers who share a passion for adventure and storytelling. Together, we'll create a dynamic and engaging game world, full of interesting characters, complex puzzles, and unexpected twists.

As an open source project, anyone is welcome to contribute to the game's development, from adding new content and features to improving the game's mechanics and user interface. We encourage contributors of all skill levels to get involved and help shape the future of Osim.
